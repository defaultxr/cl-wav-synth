*Note*: cl-wav-synth depends on McCLIM, a graphic toolkit for Common Lisp
(http://www.cliki.net/McCLIM) and CLX, a low level, Xlib-like library
on top of which McCLIM is built (http://www.cliki.net/CLX). Make sure
these are properly installed on your system before attempting to install
cl-wav-synth.

Install instructions for cl-wav-synth.  We assume that if you have gotten
this far, it means that you have either extracted a tar file with
everything in it, or checked out the files from some CVS repository.

1. Get ASDF : http://www.cliki.net/asdf

   * (load (compile-file "asdf.lisp"))

2. Load McCLIM in your lisp implementation:

   * (push "/where/is/mcclim/" asdf:*central-registry*)

   * (push "/where/is/mcclim/spatial-trees/" asdf:*central-registry*)

   * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :mcclim)

3. Load the McCLIM listener 

   * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clim-listener)

3'. Optionally, you can save a lisp image with McCLIM and the listener
   loaded in:

   * (save-lisp "cmucl-mcclim.core")          ; for CMUCL
   * (save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-mcclim.core")   ; for SBCL
   * (saveinitmem "clisp-mcclim.core")        ; for CLISP

   You can then load the core image with the appropriate command line.

4. If you want to play sounds with the mikmod library, you have to
   load cffi from http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/.
   If cffi is not found the default player is the sox player. In the
   other case, the mikmod library is used as the default player.

   * (push "/where/is/cffi/" asdf:*central-registry*)

   * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cffi)

5. Optionally, you can edit cl-wav-synth.lisp and
   cl-wav-synth-clim.lisp to set the default values for cl-wav-synth.
   The default player is dplay and call 'play' the sox player. So be
   sure to have sox installed in your system or change the default
   value in cl-wav-synth.lisp.

6. Load cl-wav-synth

   * (push "/where/is/cl-wav-synth/" asdf:*central-registry*)

   * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-wav-synth)   ; Optional

   * (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-wav-synth-clim)

   Another way to do this step in to load the file load.lisp in your
   system.


7. Run cl-wav-synth

   * (wav-clim:run)

8. And have a look to the help
