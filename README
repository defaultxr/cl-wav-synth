  Introduction

   cl-wav-synth is a wav sample editor. It comes in two parts, the main
   library for manipulating wav files and a (Mc)CLIM interface with a
   full lisp listener, a sample pane editor, a spectrum pane editor and a
   song pane editor.

  Installation

   To run the CLIM CLI interface of cl-wav-synth, you need a lisp
   implementation* with asdf, [1]McCLIM and the CLIM Listener built in.
   Then you can load the file load.lisp or edit it for tweaking.

   * Tested with CMUCL (GNU/Linux x86, MacOS X), SBCL (GNU/Linux x86 and
   PPC, MacOS X) and CLISP (GNU/Linux x86 and PPC, MacOS X and
   MS-Windows)

   With MS Windows, you must have the coolplayer in your path.
   (http://coolplayer.sourceforge.net/)

   By default, you'll nead the sox player (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) or
   the mikmod library (http://mikmod.raphnet.net/) and cffi
   (http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/) loaded in your lisp image.
   And indeed, if you want the McCLIM interface, you'll have to compile McCLIM
   in your lisp image.

  Description

   cl-wav-synth is a wav sample editor. The wav sample editor is driven
   from the lisp REPL: you can watch immediately the result of each
   applied functions. cl-wav-synth comes with some effects as echo,
   delay, pitch...

   The spectrum editor is here just for educational purpose. It show the
   effect of adding sinus together. But it can load spectrum from the
   sharc project and can be used to produce instruments sounds (the
   sample amplitude need to be modified to have a real sound).

   The song editor is a way to express a song. A song is just a list of
   events to write on a wav file. cl-wav-synth traverses the song list
   and evaluates the form of each song-sample, if the result is a wav
   sample, it is merged in the song wav file.

   cl-wav-synth is under the [20]LLGPL licence (Lisp Lesser GNU Public
   License).
